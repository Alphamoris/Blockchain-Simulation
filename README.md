## üéØ Usage Guide

### 1. Exploring the Blockchain

The main dashboard displays:
- **Blockchain Statistics**: Total blocks, transactions, mining difficulty, and rewards
- **Block Visualization**: Interactive blocks showing hash values, transactions, and timestamps
- **Validation Tools**: Verify the integrity of the entire blockchain

Use the validation feature to check that all blocks are correctly linked and all transactions are properly signed.

### 2. Wallet Management

- **Create Wallets**: Generate new cryptographic key pairs for transaction signing
- **View Balances**: Monitor account balances across the blockchain
- **Secure Keys**: Private keys are displayed only once at creation (save them securely!)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Note**: In a real blockchain, you would never share your private key. For educational purposes only, this simulator displays the private key at wallet creation.

### 3. Transaction Creation

Creating transactions is simple:
1. Select a source wallet (sender)
2. Select a destination wallet (recipient)
3. Enter the amount to transfer
4. Create the transaction

All transactions are cryptographically signed and wait in the pending transactions pool until mined into a block.

### 4. Mining Process

The mining interface demonstrates proof-of-work:
- Select a wallet to receive the mining reward
- Start the mining process to create a new block
- Watch as the system computes a valid nonce that satisfies the difficulty requirement
- Observe how balances update after mining is complete

The mining reward is automatically added to the selected miner's wallet.

### 5. Tamper Detection Demo

To demonstrate blockchain's tamper-proof nature:
1. Select an existing block
2. Modify transaction data
3. Observe how the hash values no longer match
4. Validate the chain to see how the system detects the tampering

This demonstrates blockchain's immutability - once data is added, it cannot be changed without invalidating the entire chain.

### 6. Quick Demo

The "Run Demo" button automatically:
- Creates three sample wallets (Alice, Bob, Miner)
- Generates test transactions between them
- Mines a block containing those transactions
- Updates the blockchain visualization

This is perfect for a quick overview of the entire blockchain process.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Block**
   - Properties: index, timestamp, transactions, previousHash, hash, nonce
   - Methods: calculateHash(), mineBlock()
   - Purpose: Represents a single block in the blockchain

2. **Blockchain**
   - Properties: chain, difficulty, pendingTransactions, miningReward
   - Methods: createGenesisBlock(), getLatestBlock(), minePendingTransactions(), addTransaction(), isChainValid()
   - Purpose: Manages the chain of blocks and provides chain-level operations

3. **Transaction**
   - Properties: fromAddress, toAddress, amount, timestamp, signature
   - Methods: calculateHash(), signTransaction(), isValid()
   - Purpose: Represents a transfer of value between addresses

4. **Wallet**

   - Purpose: Manages cryptographic keys for transaction signing

### Data Flow

1. **Wallet Creation**: Generate public/private key pairs
2. **Transaction Creation**: Sign transactions with private keys
3. **Transaction Pool**: Pending transactions await mining
4. **Mining Process**: 
   - Group pending transactions into a block

## üß† Blockchain Concepts Explained

### Cryptographic Hash Functions

BlockSim uses SHA-256 hashing which transforms input data into a fixed-size string of characters. Key properties:
- **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same output
- **Fast Computation**: Quickly calculate hash from any input
- **Avalanche Effect**: Small changes in input create large changes in output
- **One-way Function**: Cannot derive input from output

### Digital Signatures

Transactions use elliptic curve cryptography to create signatures that:
- **Prove Ownership**: Only the private key owner can create valid signatures
- **Prevent Tampering**: Any change to transaction data invalidates the signature
- **Non-repudiation**: Sender cannot deny creating the transaction

### Proof-of-Work

Mining implements a simplified proof-of-work algorithm:
1. Take transaction data + previous hash + nonce
2. Calculate SHA-256 hash
3. Check if hash meets difficulty target (starts with specific number of zeros)
4. If not, increment nonce and try again
5. Process continues until valid hash is found

This makes block creation computationally intensive, securing the blockchain against tampering.

### Blockchain Immutability

The chain structure creates immutability:
- Each block contains the previous block's hash
- Changing any data in a block changes its hash
- This invalidates all subsequent blocks
- To tamper with data, an attacker would need to redo the proof-of-work for that block and all blocks after it

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

We plan to add more features to BlockSim in future releases:

- **Consensus Algorithms**: Implement proof-of-stake and other consensus mechanisms
- **Smart Contracts**: Add basic smart contract functionality
- **Merkle Trees**: Implement Merkle trees for efficient transaction validation
- **P2P Network Simulation**: Demonstrate distributed consensus across nodes
- **Advanced Block Explorer**: Enhanced visualization of blockchain data
- **Performance Metrics**: Hash rate, difficulty adjustment, and network statistics
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application for iOS and Android

## üêû Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Transaction Creation Fails**: Check if the source wallet has sufficient balance
- **Mining Takes Too Long**: Reduce the mining difficulty in the blockchain configuration
- **Invalid Chain After Tampering**: This is expected behavior demonstrating blockchain integrity

### Browser Compatibility

The application works best in:
- Chrome (v90+)
- Firefox (v85+)
- Edge (v90+)
- Safari (v14+)
